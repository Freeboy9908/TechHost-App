Sometimes we are a bit lazy to open the browser to access the panel. That's why this android app was created, yeah! to access the panel too.
This app uses WebKit WebView technology (not Chrome Custom Tabs) which allows the app to access the panel.

This app can only run on android 4.4 to 9.0 (I'm not sure if Android 10 can too) and requires internet network & storage permission.
## Known bugs
Just like Vanellope von Schweetz, this app also has some bugs such as:
- Sometimes the panel load really really long.
- ~~Discord Widget that doesn't too work especially when using it on the login page.~~
